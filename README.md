# Skill Bank

![Skillbank screenshot](skillbank1.png)

This is a project trying out node and sqlite3. 
It's a prototype for a skill sharing site, which works as a message board on which people can offer or request certain skills or know-how. Skills are tagged in several categories, the buttons on the top can be used to sort them by category.

At this stage it's not properly responsive, but i'd like to work work on a functioning version in the future to be able to give it a test-run with some users.
[A version without database](https://skillbank.herokuapp.com/#) is deployed via Heroku.

I developed this project during my studies at the BeCode web dev course.
